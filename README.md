- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZachInSpace
👀 I’m interested in learning to code for automation. From there, I plan to continue learning and working with CTFs with the objective of entering InfoSec.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’ve created some things I wanted but couldn't find online.
- I need to use this platform more, and most of my coding projects live in my folders on my computers instead of on GitHub.
